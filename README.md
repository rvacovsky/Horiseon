# Horiseon

## User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a webpage meets accessibility standards, when I view the source code I find semantic HTML elements. When I view the structure of the HTML elements then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I view the image elements I find accessible alt attributes. When I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order. When I view the title element I find a concise, descriptive title.
